		dev_t     st_dev     ID of device containing file
		ino_t     st_ino     file serial number
		mode_t    st_mode    mode of file (see below)
		nlink_t   st_nlink   number of links to the file
		uid_t     st_uid     user ID of file
		gid_t     st_gid     group ID of file
		dev_t     st_rdev    device ID (if file is character or block special)
		off_t     st_size    file size in bytes (if file is a regular file)
		time_t    st_atime   time of last access
		time_t    st_mtime   time of last data modification
		time_t    st_ctime   time of last status change
		blksize_t st_blksize a filesystem-specific preferred I/O block size for this object.  In some filesystem types, this may vary from file to file
		blkcnt_t  st_blocks  number of blocks allocated for this object

				read, write, execute/search by owner				read permission, owner 			write permission, owner

			S_IXUSR										S_IRWXG											S_IRGRP
				execute/search permission, owner			read, write, execute/search by group			read permission, group
